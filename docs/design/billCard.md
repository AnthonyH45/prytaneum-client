#  Official Stats Page Design Doc

Stats page will contain a list of relevant bills. Each bill will be represented in material ui card component. The card component intended to be used can be found [here](https://kstatic.googleusercontent.com/files/a57b745b63a7c934070d38b663771c4861aa53c5390b1f20c3eeb77accdba63ae15e44b7d3f13421da2943b60f87e528670c9d718840667a7b6787e5b572482d)

Weather data will be replaced by Nivo charts/graphs that illustrate vote breakdown of the bills from Members of Congress. A progress bar/stepper component will be used to keep track of the bill's progress into written law. The card will also contain a synopsis of the bill and the official digital source of the bill when the card is expanded.


Also included is a rough drawing/mock up of the offical page.
